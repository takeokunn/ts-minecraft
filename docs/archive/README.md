- It has been superseded by newer documentation
- It does not fit the Diátaxis framework (explanations, how-to guides, reference, tutorials)
- It is in a language that is not actively maintained (e.g., Japanese content when primary documentation is English)

## Retention

Archived content is retained for:
- Historical reference
- Potential future reactivation
- External links that may still point to this content

**Note**: Archived documentation should not be used for current project workflows. Refer to the main documentation structure for up-to-date information.
